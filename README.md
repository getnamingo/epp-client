## Introduction  

**Namingo EPP** is an open-source PHP library and tool for working with EPP (Extensible Provisioning Protocol). It provides everything you need to connect to EPP servers, manage domains, and build custom integrations.  

- Works as both a **library** for developers and a **ready-to-use client**  
- Includes **Loom**, **WHMCS** and **FOSSBilling** registrar modules for easy automation  
- Supports EPP extensions and can be **extended to new backends** with minimal effort  
- Simple to integrate into any PHP project  

With Namingo EPP you can start small, customize as you go, and adapt it to the specific requirements of any domain registry.

### Integration with billing systems

Would you like to see any registry added as a WHMCS/FOSSBilling module? Or an EPP module for any other billing system? Simply create an [issue](https://github.com/getnamingo/epp-client/issues) in this project and let us know.

| Platform | TLDs | Project |
|----------|----------|----------|
| WHMCS EPP Registrar | any | [whmcs-epp-registrar](https://github.com/getnamingo/whmcs-epp-registrar) |
| FOSSBilling EPP Registrar | any | [fossbilling-epp-registrar](https://github.com/getnamingo/fossbilling-epp-registrar) |

## Installation

To begin, follow these steps for setting up the EPP Client. This installation process is optimized for a VPS running Ubuntu 22.04/24.04 or Debian 12/13.

### 1. Install PHP

#### Ubuntu 22.04 / 24.04

```bash
apt update
apt install -y curl software-properties-common ufw

add-apt-repository -y ppa:ondrej/php
apt update

apt install -y \
  composer git net-tools unzip wget whois \
  php8.3-bz2 php8.3-cli php8.3-common php8.3-curl \
  php8.3-gmp php8.3-intl php8.3-mbstring php8.3-xml
```

#### Debian 12 / 13

```bash
apt update
apt install -y ca-certificates curl gnupg lsb-release ufw

curl -fsSL https://packages.sury.org/php/apt.gpg \
  | gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/sury-php.gpg

echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/sury-php.gpg] https://packages.sury.org/php/ $(lsb_release -sc) main" \
  > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/sury-php.list

apt update

apt install -y \
  composer git net-tools unzip wget whois \
  php8.3-bz2 php8.3-cli php8.3-common php8.3-curl \
  php8.3-gmp php8.3-intl php8.3-mbstring php8.3-xml
```

### 2. Install EPP Client Package

Navigate to your project directory and run the following command:

```bash
composer require pinga/tembo
```

### 3. Configure Access to the Registry

Edit the `examples/Connection.php` file to configure your registry access credentials (host, port, username, password, certificates, etc.).

If the registry requires SSL certificates and you don't have them, refer to the troubleshooting section for steps to generate `cert.pem` and `key.pem`.

### 4. Detailed Logging

The EPP Client supports full logging of raw XML commands and responses via a PSR-3 compatible logger. For detailed debugging (including `<command>` and `<response>` XML), we recommend using Monolog.

Run this in your project root:

```bash
composer require monolog/monolog
```

Check `examples/Connection.php` for details on how to enable logger. Make sure you have `use` statements for the selected package.

## Using the EPP Client

- You can use the commands provided in the `examples` directory to interact with the EPP server.

- Alternatively, include the `Connection.php` file in your project and build your custom application using the `EppClient` class and its functions.

## Troubleshooting

### EPP Server Access

If you're unsure whether your system can access the EPP server, you can test the connection using OpenSSL. Try one or both of the following commands:

1. Basic Connectivity Test:

```bash
openssl s_client -showcerts -connect epp.example.com:700
```

2. Test with Client Certificates:

```bash
openssl s_client -connect epp.example.com:700 -CAfile cacert.pem -cert cert.pem -key key.pem
```

Replace `epp.example.com` with your EPP server's hostname and adjust the paths to your certificate files (`cacert.pem`, `cert.pem`, and `key.pem`) as needed. These tests can help identify issues with SSL/TLS configurations or network connectivity.

### Generating an SSL Certificate and Key

If you do not have an SSL certificate and private key for secure communication with the registry, you can generate one using OpenSSL.

```bash
openssl genrsa -out key.pem 2048
openssl req -new -x509 -key key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365
```

**Note:** For production environments, it's recommended to use a certificate signed by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA) instead of a self-signed certificate.

### EPP-over-HTTPS Issues

If you experience login or other issues with EPP-over-HTTPS registries such as `.eu`, `.fi`, `.hr`, `.it`, or `.lv`, it might be caused by a corrupted or outdated cookie file. Follow these steps to fix it:

```bash
rm -f /tmp/eppcookie.txt
```

After deleting the cookie file, try logging in again. This will force the creation of a new cookie file and may resolve the issue.

### Need More Help?

If the steps above don’t resolve your issue, refer to the EPP Client logs (`/path/to/tembo/log`) to identify the specific problem.

## Benchmarking an EPP Server

To run tests against an EPP server using the Namingo EPP client, follow these steps:

### 1. Configure Your Connection

Edit the file `benchmark/Connection.php` - this file should contain the connection details for the server you want to test. It uses the same format as `examples/Connection.php`.

### 2. Run the Benchmark

From the root directory, run `php benchmark/Benchmark.php` - this will execute a series of domain check commands to test your server’s response and performance.

### 3. Customize the Benchmark

You can modify `benchmark/Benchmark.php` to:
- Add your own EPP commands
- Change the number of requests
- Adjust the test logic

Use this script as a starting point to test and tune your EPP server setup.
