## Introduction  

**Namingo EPP** is an open-source PHP library and tool for working with EPP (Extensible Provisioning Protocol). It provides everything you need to connect to EPP servers, manage domains, and build custom integrations.  

- Works as both a **library** for developers and a **ready-to-use client**  
- Includes **Loom**, **WHMCS** and **FOSSBilling** registrar modules for easy automation  
- Supports EPP extensions and can be **extended to new backends** with minimal effort  
- Simple to integrate into any PHP project  

With Namingo EPP you can start small, customize as you go, and adapt it to the specific requirements of any domain registry.

## Documentation

### Installation

To begin, follow these steps for setting up the EPP Client. This installation process is optimized for a VPS running Ubuntu 22.04/24.04 or Debian 12/13.

#### 1. Install PHP

Make sure PHP is installed on your server. Use the appropriate commands for your operating system.

```bash
apt install -y curl software-properties-common ufw
add-apt-repository ppa:ondrej/php
apt update
apt install -y bzip2 composer git net-tools php8.3 php8.3-bz2 php8.3-cli php8.3-common php8.3-curl php8.3-fpm php8.3-gd php8.3-gmp php8.3-imagick php8.3-intl php8.3-mbstring php8.3-opcache php8.3-readline php8.3-soap php8.3-xml unzip wget whois
```

#### 2. Install Tembo Package

Navigate to your project directory and run the following command:

```bash
composer require pinga/tembo
```

#### 3. Configure Access to the Registry

Edit the `examples/Connection.php` file to configure your registry access credentials.
If the registry requires SSL certificates and you don't have them, refer to the troubleshooting section for steps to generate `cert.pem` and `key.pem`.

#### Using the EPP Client

- You can use the commands provided in the `examples` directory to interact with the EPP server.

- Alternatively, include the `Connection.php` file in your project and build your custom application using the `EppClient` class and its functions.

### Troubleshooting

#### EPP Server Access

If you're unsure whether your system can access the EPP server, you can test the connection using OpenSSL. Try one or both of the following commands:

1. Basic Connectivity Test:

```bash
openssl s_client -showcerts -connect epp.example.com:700
```

2. Test with Client Certificates:

```bash
openssl s_client -connect epp.example.com:700 -CAfile cacert.pem -cert cert.pem -key key.pem
```

Replace `epp.example.com` with your EPP server's hostname and adjust the paths to your certificate files (`cacert.pem`, `cert.pem`, and `key.pem`) as needed. These tests can help identify issues with SSL/TLS configurations or network connectivity.

#### Generating an SSL Certificate and Key

If you do not have an SSL certificate and private key for secure communication with the registry, you can generate one using OpenSSL.

```bash
openssl genrsa -out key.pem 2048
openssl req -new -x509 -key key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365
```

**Note:** For production environments, it's recommended to use a certificate signed by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA) instead of a self-signed certificate.

#### EPP-over-HTTPS Issues

If you experience login or other issues with EPP-over-HTTPS registries such as `.eu`, `.fi`, `.hr`, `.it`, or `.lv`, it might be caused by a corrupted or outdated cookie file. Follow these steps to fix it:

```bash
rm -f /tmp/eppcookie.txt
```

After deleting the cookie file, try logging in again. This will force the creation of a new cookie file and may resolve the issue.

#### Need More Help?

If the steps above don‚Äôt resolve your issue, refer to the EPP Client logs (`/path/to/tembo/log`) to identify the specific problem.

### Benchmarking an EPP Server

To run tests against an EPP server using the Namingo EPP client, follow these steps:

#### 1. Configure Your Connection

Edit the file `benchmark/Connection.php` - this file should contain the connection details for the server you want to test. It uses the same format as `examples/Connection.php`.

#### 2. Run the Benchmark

From the root directory, run `php benchmark/Benchmark.php` - this will execute a series of domain check commands to test your server‚Äôs response and performance.

#### 3. Customize the Benchmark

You can modify `benchmark/Benchmark.php` to:
- Add your own EPP commands
- Change the number of requests
- Adjust the test logic

Use this script as a starting point to test and tune your EPP server setup.
